# Final Project: Analyzing the Impact of Gamification towards Education

## Abstract
The study evaluates the impact of gamified learning platforms on students’ academic performance using statistical analyses and data visualizations. Through this study, we have found statistically significant improvement in final exam scores for platform users, as revealed by a dependent t-test and Cohen's d effect size. However, have also found weak and non-significant findings when analyzing quiz engagement levels and academic performance through ANOVA and Pearson's correlation. We discuss the contradictory findings, as well as limitations such as dataset variability and lack of granular engagement data are discussed. The findings highlight gamification's potential benefits but also the need for more detailed and representative datasets.
