    "Gamification in an educational setting has significantly increased in recent years. These platforms often rely on incorporating reward-based mechanics such as leaderboards, badges, point systems, and quizes to promote learning. With platforms such as *BrainPop*, *IXL*, *Kahoot!*, and *Quizlet* offering a fun and interactive environment, students are motivated to actively engage in the learning process. \n",
    "\n",
    "While several studies have indicated positive impacts of gamified learning platforms, the degree of effectiveness remains contentious. Additionally, some studies discuss the ethical implications of gamified learning platforms, such as the overemphasis on competition, coersion/persuasion, and unsustainability of these platforms in the long-term. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of these conflicting findings, this project seeks to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of gamified learning platforms on students' academic performance."

    "Gamification, a term first coined by game designer Nick Pelling in the early 21st century, refers to the concept of using game elements and mechanics to non-game contexts to increase product engagement [1]. While the term itself is relatively new, the concept of gamification can be dated back to the early 1900s through the Boy Scout Movement where boy scouts earned badges for their achievements [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of time, designers have gained a better understanding into the underlying mechanics that make gamification engaging and boost motivation. From a behavioral psychology perspective, gamification utilizes persuasive mechanisms such as rewards, feedback loops, competition, and intrinsic motivations into these systems [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamification in education started seeing significant progress in integration during the 2010s. Platforms that incorporated game mechanics into the learning process, like *Kahoot!* and *Classcraft*, gained popularity among students by making the learning process fun [2]. Its popularity can also be credited to how computer systems became much more ubiquitous during the 21st century [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies evaluating the effectiveness of gamification in education have shown a positive correlation between platform usage and academic performance. However, it is important to note that these studies have also found the relationship to be unstable: \"Two meta-analysis studies [...] show that applying gamification in education can improve cognitive, motivational and behavioral learning outcomes with small to medium effect sizes (0.25 to 0.56). However, [...] the size of the reported effect [...] is not stable\" [4]. Much is still unknown about the factors that contribute to the efficacy of gamification, as well as how gamification holds up in the long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also debates pertaining to the ethical implications of gamification. According to Yu-Kai Chou, an entrepreneur and experience designer that pinoneered the industry of gamification, \"gamification is manipulative\" [5]. In otherwords, the mechanisms in gamification are very powerful in terms of persuasion. With a number of gamified platforms placing high value towards badge collection and ranks in leaderboards, it is easy for users to lose \"sight of why their action is desirable\" [5]. To balance, the key in creating a user friendly gamified platform would be transparency in experience: \"one where the consumer knows that they‚Äôre playing\" [5]."
