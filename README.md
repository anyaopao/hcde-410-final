# Final Project: Analyzing the Impact of the Pandemic on Video Game Console Sales

The COVID-19 pandemic led to global quarantines and lockdowns, forcing people to 
isolate and limit social interactions for an extended period of time.

Video games can offer a sense of social connection and entertainment through their 
immersive and interactive nature.

In response to these challenging times, many turned to video games as a means for 
escapism from reality.

This project aims to study the relationship trend between video game sales before, 
during, and after the pandemic. By cross-analyzing sales data and COVID-19, this 
study aims to gain insight into how global events, such as the pandemic, influences 
entertainment consumption.
