# Final Project: Analyzing the Impact of Gamification towards Education

## Abstract
Gamification in an educational setting has significantly increased in recent years. These platforms often rely on incorporating reward-based mechanics such as leaderboards, badges, point systems, and quizes to promote learning. With platforms such as BrainPop, IXL, Kahoot!, and Quizlet offering a fun and interactive environment, students are motivated to actively engage in the learning process.

While several studies have indicated positive impacts of gamified learning platforms, the degree of effectiveness remains contentious. Additionally, some studies discuss the ethical implications of gamified learning platforms, such as the overemphasis on competition, coersion/persuasion, and unsustainability of these platforms in the long-term.

In light of these conflicting findings, this project seeks to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of gamified learning platforms on students' academic performance.
